This directory contains fine-grained hyperDAGs generated from an input matrix file (gyro_m.mtx, available at https://sparse.tamu.edu/Oberwolfach/gyro_m) with the hyperDAG generator tool. The file names describe the mode and parameters used for the generation.

For a detailed description of the generating methods and the parameters, see the readme file of the generator tool in tools/HyperDAG_generator/README.txt.
