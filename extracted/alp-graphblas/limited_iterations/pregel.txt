%%MatrixMarket weighted-matrix coordinate pattern general
%	 There are 3 unique source vertex types present in this graph. An index of source type ID and their description follows:
%		 0: input scalar
%		 1: ALP/GraphBLAS container
%		 2: input iterator
%	 There are 6 unique operation vertex types present in this graph. An index of vertex type ID and their description follows:
%		 6: clear( vector )
%		 9: set( vector, scalar )
%		 11: set( vector, vector, scalar )
%		 63: vxm( vector, vector, vector, matrix, ring )
%		 71: buildMatrixUnique( matrix, scalar, scalar, scalar )
%		 102: eWiseLambda( function, vector )
%	 There are 1 unique output vertex types present in this graph. An index of output vertex type ID and their description follows:
%		 103: output container
%        This trace corresponds to the lead-up, steady-state, and wind-down of executing any ALP/Pregel algorithm on any combination of
%        dataset and vertex-centric program, assuming that said combination would execute using two or more rounds.
