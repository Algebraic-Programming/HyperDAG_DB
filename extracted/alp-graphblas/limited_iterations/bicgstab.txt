%	 There are 3 unique source vertex types present in this graph. An index of source type ID and their description follows:
%		 0: input scalar
%		 1: ALP/GraphBLAS container
%		 2: input iterator
%	 There are 8 unique operation vertex types present in this graph. An index of vertex type ID and their description follows:
%		 9: set( vector, scalar )
%		 12: set( vector, vector )
%		 69: mxv( vector, matrix, vector, ring )
%		 71: buildMatrixUnique( matrix, scalar, scalar, scalar )
%		 86: foldl( vector, vector, monoid)
%		 89: foldl( vector, vector, scalar )
%		 97: eWiseMul( vector, scalar, vector, scalar )
%		 102: eWiseLambda( function, vector )
%	 There are 1 unique output vertex types present in this graph. An index of output vertex type ID and their description follows:
%		 103: output container
%        This hyperDAG corresponds to that of a lead-up, steady-state, and wind-down of a canonical BiCGstab linear system solver
%        implemented in ALP/GraphBLAS. This particular hyperDAG is extracted from running three BiCGstab iterations on the gyro_m
%        dataset, which, on exit, has not converged. This hyperDAG will be the same of that of running three BiCGstab iterations on any
%        other dataset, assuming a converging run requires more than two iterations to converge.
