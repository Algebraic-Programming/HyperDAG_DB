%%MatrixMarket weighted-matrix coordinate pattern general
%	 There are 4 unique source vertex types present in this graph. An index of source type ID and their description follows:
%		 0: input scalar
%		 1: ALP/GraphBLAS container
%		 2: input iterator
%		 3: input integer
%	 There are 10 unique operation vertex types present in this graph. An index of vertex type ID and their description follows:
%		 7: setElement( vector )
%		 9: set( vector, scalar )
%		 10: set( vector, vector, vector )
%		 12: set( vector, vector )
%		 19: eWiseLambda( f, vector )
%		 20: buildVector( vector, scalar, scalar, scalar, scalar )
%		 69: mxv( vector, matrix, vector, ring )
%		 71: buildMatrixUnique( matrix, scalar, scalar, scalar )
%		 75: resize( matrix, scalar )
%		 102: eWiseLambda( function, vector )
%	 There are 1 unique output vertex types present in this graph. An index of output vertex type ID and their description follows:
